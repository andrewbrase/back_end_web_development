// more ways to declare a variable
var hisName = "bob"
let myName = "andrew"
const pi = 3.14

/*
difference between var let and const
VAR is going to be able to be used throughout the entire program
LET will only be used within the scope of where it was declared
CONST is a variable that cannot change / should not change
