Node.js is a javascript runtime built on googles open-source V8 JS engine
can be used to execute JS code outside of a web browser
perfect conditions for using node.js as a web server
we can use JS on the server-side of web development

Reasons to use node.js 
- API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL)
- data streaming
- real time chat application
- server-side web application

Don't use with
- applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive)
- that would be better for languages like Python, ruby on rails or php

NPM: a huge library of open-source packages available for everyone to use
we will use node to create a web server
